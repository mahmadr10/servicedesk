// the client (that can expose file paths, library versions, etc. to an
// attacker). Always return the same JSON shape, and always include the
// requestId — so a user reporting "I got an error" can hand support that id,
// and support can find the FULL error (with stack trace) in the structured
// logs by searching for it, without ever exposing that detail to the client.
