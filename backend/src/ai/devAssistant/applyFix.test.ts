// These cover every REJECTION path — all of which throw before ever
// spawning the nested `npm test` run, so they stay fast here. The actual
// successful-apply-then-verify-with-tests and the
// applies-then-auto-reverts-on-test-failure paths were verified live
// against real Groq-generated fixes on disposable scratch files (see
// BUILD_LOG.md) rather than automated here — a nested `npm test` inside
// this already-running test suite would work, but at ~10-15s per
// assertion for marginal benefit over what was already proven live.
