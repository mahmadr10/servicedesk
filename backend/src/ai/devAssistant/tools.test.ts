// combined phrase and searched for it as a literal substring, so a genuinely
// answerable question ("where is authentication implemented") came back
// empty every time — nothing in the code says "authentication implemented"
// verbatim. Fixed by returning multiple OR-able keywords, expanded through a
// small synonym table for this codebase's actual vocabulary.
