// since "authentication" is a far better search term than "this").

// earlier in the walk order, before ever reaching the file the SPECIFIC
// keyword (the actual identifier) would have found. Fixed by scoring every
// candidate line by the combined LENGTH of the keywords it matches (a
// longer, rarer keyword like a specific identifier outweighs several
// matches of a short, generic word) and keeping the highest-scoring lines,
