// The ONLY place in this entire feature that writes to a source file — and
// even here, only when a human has explicitly reviewed a diff and clicked
// "Apply" (see controllers/adminController.ts / the frontend's Suggested
// Fix panel). Everything below exists to make that one write as safe as a
// deliberately-triggered, reviewable, auto-verified write CAN be:
//   1. Path validation — can only target real .ts/.tsx application source
//      under backend/src or frontend/src, never this tool's own code,
//      never .env/config/package.json/node_modules.
//   2. Exact-match validation — `oldCode` must appear in the CURRENT file
//      content EXACTLY ONCE. Zero matches (file changed, hallucinated
//      snippet) or multiple matches (ambiguous — which one?) both reject
//      outright rather than guess.
//   3. Apply, then IMMEDIATELY run the real test suite. Tests fail →
//      automatic revert to the original content, nothing durable happens.
//      Tests pass → the change is kept.
