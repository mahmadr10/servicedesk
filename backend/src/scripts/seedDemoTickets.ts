// Run manually with: npm run seed:demo
//
// `seed:users` creates the 3 demo accounts but no tickets — logging in
// right after that shows an empty "My Tickets"/queue/dashboard, which is a
// weak demo (a single ticket created live is the right thing to SHOW, but
// an admin's Dashboard/Analytics/Audit Logs screens need more than one data
// point to look like anything). This creates a small, realistic, HAND-
// CURATED spread (not `seed:perf`'s 10,000 random rows — that's for query
// benchmarking, not a demo video) across every status/priority/category, so
// the dashboard/analytics/audit-log screens have something real to show
// before you've clicked anything.
