// One shared, structured logger for the whole backend. "Structured" means
// every log line is a JSON object with consistent fields (timestamp,
// level, message, plus whatever context we attach) — not free-form text.
// That's what makes logs actually SEARCHABLE in a real deployment (e.g.
// "show me every error for userId X in the last hour") instead of just
// scrollback you read with your eyes.
//
// In development we pipe through pino-pretty for a human-readable
// colorized line-by-line view; in production we emit raw JSON (what a log
// aggregator like Datadog/CloudWatch/Grafana Loki actually wants).

  // must never be the thing that breaks actual application logging.
