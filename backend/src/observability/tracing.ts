// OpenTelemetry bootstrap — MUST be imported before anything else in the
// process (see src/index.ts, where this is the literal first import). Node's
// auto-instrumentation works by monkey-patching modules (http, express,
// mongodb, ...) the moment they're `require`d; if app.ts or any of its
// dependencies were imported first, those specific modules would already be
// bound to their un-patched originals and would silently produce no spans.
//
// Demonstrates the exact chain the spec asks for:
//   HTTP Request → Express Route → Service → MongoDB
// "HTTP Request" and "Express Route" and "MongoDB" come for free from the
// auto-instrumentations below (http, express, mongodb — mongoose sits on top
// of the mongodb driver, so instrumenting the driver covers it). "Service" is
// NOT auto-instrumented (it's just plain function calls, nothing to patch) —
// see observability/otel.ts's `withSpan()`, used explicitly in a handful of
// representative service functions so that layer shows up in the trace too.
