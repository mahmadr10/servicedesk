// Categories used to be a hardcoded enum. An admin needs to "configure
// categories" per the spec, so they're now a real collection an admin can
// add to / retire — tickets store the category NAME (a string), not a
// reference id. That's a deliberate denormalization: ticket documents and
// analytics queries ("tickets by category") stay simple string
// group-bys/filters instead of needing a $lookup join on every read. The
// trade-off: renaming a category doesn't retroactively rename it on old
// tickets. For a support-ticket history, that's usually what you want
// anyway (the ticket keeps the label it had at the time).
