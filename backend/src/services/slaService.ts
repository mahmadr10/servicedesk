// math itself (the part most likely to have an off-by-one or timezone bug)
// is easy to unit test in isolation.
//
// Timezone handling: every timestamp here is a JavaScript Date, which
// internally is always UTC (epoch milliseconds) — there's no "which
// timezone is this Date in" ambiguity to get wrong. The only place a
// timezone matters is when FORMATTING a Date for display, and that's the
// frontend's job (the browser's local timezone), not the backend's. The
// backend only ever adds minutes to timestamps and compares timestamps —
// operations that are timezone-agnostic by construction.
