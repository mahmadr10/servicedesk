// The one mandatory E2E workflow the spec asks for: login → create ticket
// → agent login → assign → update status → resolve → customer closes.
// Playwright drives a REAL browser against the REAL running app (both
// servers below), so this is the closest thing to "does the whole system
// actually work" — as opposed to unit tests (one function) or integration
// tests (one API call at a time, no browser/UI involved at all).
//
// Ports 4001/5175 (not the usual 4000/5173) are deliberate — dedicated
// ports nothing else on the machine would already be using, so Playwright
// can never accidentally attach to an unrelated already-running server
// (which is exactly what happened during development here: another
// project's dev server was already on 5173).
